## Motivation

I recently got interested in crypto markets and wanted to be able to convert prices to fiat currency in a simple and straighforward way. I also wanted to have a display of current prices and changes.

## Demo

App provides converter, has a toggle view between cards and a table, and a switch between light and dark mode.

## Future plans
