## ðŸ¤“ Motivation

I recently got interested in crypto markets and wanted to be able to convert prices to fiat currency in a simple and straighforward way. I also wanted to have a display of current prices and changes. As I was coding the app, every time I fetched data I found out the current prices which was an added bonus for me and made working on the app even more enjoyable.

## ðŸ‘€Demo

App provides a converter that works from and to cryptocurrencies. Each input has a select with currencies that updates the exchange rate.      
There is also a dashboard with current data. Option to toggle view between cards and a table. MUI Table offers built in filtering and sorting tool.     
User can switch between light and dark mode.
